2,arange,Like the built-in range but returns an ndarray instead of a list
3,"ones, ones_like",Produce an array of all 1s with the given shape and dtype; ones_like takes another array and produces a ones array of the same shape and dtype
4,"zeros, zeros_like",Like ones and ones_like but producing arrays of 0s instead
5,"empty, empty_like","Create new arrays by allocating new memory, but do not populate with any values like ones and zeros"
6,"full, full_like",Produce an array of the given shape and dtype with all values set to the indicated “fill value” full_like takes another array and produces a filled array of the same shape and dtype
