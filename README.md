# books

This repository is created for tracking the progress for the practice I've started from the various books. 
The sub repos' name are based on the books I'm studying. For e.g., the repo 'pythonForDataAnalysis' contains the practice done from the book 'Python for data Analysis' by Wes Mckinney.
